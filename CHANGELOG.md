---

## [5.7.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 3.5 — CombatManager extraction** — Extracted 22 combat/effects methods (~611 lines) into `combat-manager.js`: debris effects (asteroid + enemy), orb creation/drops, powerup collection, kill streak tracking, damage numbers, money pickup display, entity targeting/hover detection
- **Architecture: Phase 3.6 — PlayerLifecycle extraction** — Extracted 9 player death/respawn methods (~379 lines) into `player-lifecycle.js`: `takeDamage`, `handlePlayerDeath`, `createPlayerShipDebris`, `respawnPlayer`, `respawnPlayerSafely`, `findSafeRespawnLocation`, `updateRespawnAnimation`, `clearAreaAroundPlayer`, `explodeTank`
- **Architecture: Phase 3.7 — WeaponEffectsRenderer extraction** — Extracted `drawWeaponEffects` (~196 lines) into `rendering/weapon-effects-renderer.js`: lance beam, mines, nova rings, lightning chains, missiles, deflector orbs, bulwark, tractor shield, EMP pulse, phase dash
- Removed unused `PRIMARY_UPGRADES`, `POWER_UPGRADES`, `SKILL_UPGRADES`, `PRIMARY_WEAPONS`, `POWER_WEAPONS` imports from `game-engine.js`
- **Architecture: Phase 3.8 — Spawning methods moved to WaveManager** — Moved 9 spawning methods (~196 lines) into existing `wave-manager.js`: `spawnAsteroidOffscreen`, `spawnWaveAsteroids`, `startEnemySubWave`, `forceSpawnEntity`, `forceSpawnEnemy`, `forceSpawnAsteroid`, `isInMinimapArea`, `spawnContinuousAsteroid`, `spawnRandomEnemy`
- `game-engine.js` reduced from 3,081 to 1,681 lines (total 78% reduction from original 7,746)

## [5.6.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 3.4 — CollisionSystem extraction** — Extracted 8 collision methods (~1,142 lines) into `collision-system.js`: `handleCollisions`, `handleWeaponEffectCollisions`, `damageEnemy`, `handlePlayerEnemyCollision`, `handlePlayerEnemyBulletCollision`, `handleEnemyAsteroidCollision`, `handlePlayerAsteroidCollision`, `findNearestEnemy`
- **Architecture: Phase 4 — GameDimensions fix** — Added `FIELD_WIDTH`/`FIELD_HEIGHT` constants to `GAME_CONFIG`, updated `GameDimensions` singleton to return fixed game field dimensions (1920×1080) instead of window viewport size, and removed all `window.gameEngine?.gameField` fallback chains from entity code (enemy.js, asteroid.js, enemy-bullet.js)
- `game-engine.js` reduced from 4,206 to 3,081 lines (total 60% reduction from original 7,746)

### Fixed
- Duplicate shield initialization in `enemy.js` (lines 221-229 and 299-307 were identical; removed the first redundant copy)
- `GameDimensions` was returning window viewport size instead of game field dimensions, which could cause entity boundary checks to use incorrect values on non-1080p displays

## [5.5.1] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Project reorganization** — Moved 10 planning/analysis docs (including REFACTOR.md) into `docs/` and development tools (`benchmark/`, `ai-qa-bot/`, `scripts/`, `juice-capture.mjs`) into `tools/` to declutter the project root
- Updated all internal path references in `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `benchmark/compare.js`, `benchmark/run.js`, `ai-qa-bot/run.js`, and `ai-qa-bot/core/config.js` to reflect new locations

## [5.5.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Architecture: Phase 1 Foundation** — Added `GameStateMachine` (validated state transitions with epoch guards), `EventBus` (cross-system pub/sub), and `GameTimer` (frame-counted timers that freeze during pause/shop)
- **Architecture: Phase 2 Renderer Extraction** — Extracted 32 HUD draw methods (~2,058 lines) into `hud-renderer.js` and 4 shop draw methods (~619 lines) into `shop-renderer.js`
- **Architecture: Phase 3 System Extraction** — Extracted camera management (~109 lines) into `camera-manager.js`, shop logic (~528 lines) into `shop-manager.js`, and wave system (~441 lines) into `wave-manager.js`
- `game-engine.js` reduced from 7,746 lines to 4,206 lines (46% reduction) while preserving identical feature-set and behavior
- All game-logic `setTimeout` calls replaced with `GameTimer` instances that respect pause/shop state — eliminates stale-callback bugs
- All state transitions now validated against a transition table — prevents invalid state changes

### Fixed
- Wave spawn timers no longer fire during PAUSED or SHOP states (was a source of ghost spawning bugs)
- State transition validation prevents impossible state changes (e.g., GAME_OVER → SHOP)
- Respawn timer now uses epoch guard to prevent stale respawn callbacks after game restart

## [5.4.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Weapons were purchasable in shop before reaching their unlockWave milestone, bypassing wave-gating entirely
- Shop PRIMARY tab now hides locked weapons until the player reaches the required wave
- `buyShopItem()` now rejects purchases of wave-locked weapons even if called programmatically

### Added
- E2E weapon economy analysis test suite (simulated 15-wave playthrough with purchase tracking)
- Wave-gating verification tests (shop visibility + purchase blocking per wave)
- Weapon stat differentiation test (verifies Pulse Cannon rebalance + unique damage values)

## [5.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Primary weapons are now free — no coin or SP cost to acquire
- Primary weapons auto-unlock at wave milestones (Storm Needles at wave 3, Scatter Gun at wave 5, Rail Driver at wave 8, Lance Beam at wave 12)
- Reduced all 19 primary weapon upgrade costs by ~30% to redirect spending toward build depth
- Pulse Cannon rebalanced: damage 1.0→0.8, range 1.0→0.85 to incentivize weapon switching
- Shop chrome shifted from gold (#FFD700) to cyan (#00ccff) to match game's HUD aesthetic — title, border, scrollbar all cyan; gold preserved only for coin currency display
- Shop tab label font size increased from 9px to 10px for readability
- Purchase feedback: green flash on successful buy, red flash on insufficient funds

### Added
- AI playtester weapon-switching support (`switchWeapons` option in `GameAI.run()`)
- `switchRandomPrimary()` method on GameAI for periodic weapon variety testing
- Weapon test helpers: `getActivePrimary()`, `getOwnedPrimaries()`, `equipPrimary()`
- QA tests for free weapon costs, wave-milestone auto-unlock, and AI weapon switching

## [5.3.3] - 2026-03-18

### Removed
- Dead `gameOver()` method (~150 lines of unused rainbow explosion code)

## [5.3.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Game starting at wave 2 due to `main.js` and `startGame()` force-setting
  state to PLAYING, bypassing the wave transition setTimeout
- Wave progression broken after wave 1 (entities never spawned because
  setTimeout callback checked for WAVE_TRANSITION but state was forced
  to PLAYING)
- Duplicate `startNextWave()` method (old dead version at line 847 merged
  into the real one with pool cleanup, health restore, player state reset)

## [5.3.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Depth-batch-renderer NaN crash: `Math.max`/`Math.min` passes NaN through;
  replaced with bitwise `|0` coercion + ternary bounds check

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Four-phase player death effect: impact freeze, ship fragmentation, main
  blast with shockwave rings, and delayed aftershock re-ignition pops
- Ship hull debris: player hull fragments into 12 line-debris pieces along
  actual hull geometry on death, flung outward with rotation
- Death overlay: brief dark-blue tint after death (holds longer on game over)
- Three sequential camera kicks on player death (25px, 18px, 10px)
- 15-frame hitstop on player death (longest in the game)
- Pithy/humorous wave subtitles for all 50 hand-written waves plus a rotating
  pool of 15 generic quips for waves 51+
- Wave 1 intro message with 2-second delay before spawning
- Wave transition delay on all waves (2s message → spawn)

### Changed
- Player death is now the most dramatic effect in the game, strictly above
  enemy kills in every feedback channel (hitstop, flash, shake, rings)

---

## [5.2.3] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- Background star colors improved: 55% blue-white, 25% white, 12% warm,
  8% orange-red
- Asteroid hue range narrowed to teal/cyan/blue/violet (150-280°) with 20%
  warm gold accents (40-60°) for stylistic cohesion
- Hit flash timer increased from 3 to 6 frames
- MAX_PARTICLES raised from 30 to 50

## [5.2.2] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- HSL color cache added to color-cache.js: quantizes and caches `hsl()`
  string construction (~50-100 fewer string allocations per frame)
- Gradient caching for engine exhaust, health bars, and asteroid tiers
  (~30-60 fewer `createLinearGradient`/`createRadialGradient` calls per frame)
- Reduced `ctx.save()`/`restore()` calls by ~70-140 per frame in particle.js
  (replaced with manual property resets)
- HSL template literals in particle.js and line-debris.js replaced with
  cached `hsl()` calls
- `Date.now()` calls in player.js `draw()` replaced with `frameClock.now`
- Pre-allocated typed arrays (Float32Array) for off-screen indicators
- Swap-and-pop removal for damage numbers (O(1) vs splice O(n))

## [5.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Depth-batch-renderer crash after several waves: bucket index could exceed
  0-10 range; added `Math.max`/`Math.min` clamping
- Stars drifting when player is stationary: added epsilon snap
  (`if abs(vel) < 0.05, vel = 0`)
- Stars moving during PAUSE/SHOP: pass `{x:0,y:0}` instead of player velocity

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Hull outline glow on player ship: full silhouette stroke that dims/brightens
  with thrust level but stays visible at idle (cyan, lineWidth 2.5)
- Non-rotating hit flash aesthetic for enemies and asteroids: world-space white
  square with 6-7 debris squares (cyan, magenta, yellow, lavender) bursting
  outward radially
- Hit flash jitter (high-frequency sine displacement)
- Kill juice hierarchy: deaths use stronger effects than hits
  - Enemy kill: hitstop 8, camera kick 14px, screen flash 0.12/3f
  - Asteroid kill: hitstop 4-6, camera kick 7-12px, screen flash 0.06-0.1/2f
- Screen flash overlay system: `triggerScreenFlash(alpha, duration)` renders
  additive white fullscreen rect after HUD
- Camera kick system: `triggerCameraKick(dx, dy, magnitude)` with directional
  lurch and exponential decay
- Hitstop system: `triggerHitstop(frames)` freezes game logic while still
  rendering
- Staggered explosion rings on enemy/asteroid death (3 rings, 50ms apart)
- Directional shrapnel streaks on death (16-24 pieces in entity color)
- Lingering embers on death (10-16 slow-drifting glowing dots)
- Delayed secondary burst sparks (80ms after death)

### Fixed
- Hit flash rotating for enemies but not asteroids: moved all flash drawing
  outside entity rotation transforms to world-space
- Chromatic aberration fuzz looking sloppy on large entities: replaced offset
  colored rectangles with small debris squares
