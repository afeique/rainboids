## Synopsis

This mobile-friendly game can be played at: https://rainboids.cat.computer

This is an asteroids clone with its own interesting mechanics and visual aesthetics. It includes:

- A rainbow-blaster
- Energy bar for your thrusters and blaster
- Pickups in the form of stars and goodies from asteroids
- A tractor beam to pickup things and recharge energy
- Interesting particle and pseudo-3d visual effects
- Mobile controls and support

It features countless enhancements and tweaks over the original 
[Monolithic Rainboids](https://github.com/afeique/rainboids-monolithic).

Most importantly, the underlying JavaScript code has been modularized for 
easier maintenance.

## 🚀 Gameplay Overview

- **Pilot your ship** through waves of 3D wireframe asteroids.
- **Shoot asteroids** for points, but watch your energy bar!
- **Collect stars** for bonus points and energy.
- **Use the tractor beam** (space/⊙) to attract stars.
- **Avoid running out of energy** or colliding with asteroids.
- **Visual direction/wing/engine triangles** help you orient your ship.
- **Asteroids near the screen edge** are nudged back toward the center for smoother gameplay.

## 🎮 Controls

### Desktop
- **Rotate**: Left/Right Arrow or A/D
- **Thrust**: Up Arrow or W
- **Brake**: Down Arrow or S
- **Fire**: Z
- **Tractor Beam**: Spacebar
- **Pause**: Escape

### Mobile
- **Joystick**: Rotate
- **↑**: Thrust
- **⌖**: Fire
- **⊙**: Tractor Beam
- **||**: Pause

---

## 🏆 Scoring
- **Hit Asteroid**: 50 points
- **Destroy Asteroid**: 100 points
- **Collect Star**: 7 points (normal), 4 points (burst)
- **Energy Use**: 1 point per unit of energy used for thrust

---

## ⚡ Energy System
- **Thrusting** drains your energy bar (configurable in `game-engine.js`)
- **Collecting stars** restores energy
- **No firing allowed** when in CRITICAL state (energy depleted)

## Module Overview

### Core Modules
- **`main.js`**: Entry point that initializes all modules and starts the game
- **`constants.js`**: All game configuration values and constants
- **`utils.js`**: Helper functions like collision detection, random number generation, etc.
- **`pool-manager.js`**: Object pooling system for efficient memory management

### Management Modules
- **`audio-manager.js`**: Handles sound effects and background music
- **`input-handler.js`**: Manages keyboard and touch input
- **`ui-manager.js`**: Handles all UI elements, overlays, and messages
- **`game-engine.js`**: Main game loop, state management, and collision detection

### Entity Modules
- **`player.js`**: Player ship with movement, shooting, and collision
- **`bullet.js`**: Bullet projectiles with wave motion effects
- **`asteroid.js`**: 3D wireframe asteroids with physics
- **`particle.js`**: Particle effects system (explosions, thrust, etc.)
- **`star.js`**: Star entities with various shapes and behaviors
- **`line-debris.js`**: Line debris from destroyed asteroids

## Usage

### Running the Modular Version
1. Open `index-modular.html` in a web browser
2. The game will automatically initialize and show the title screen
3. Click or press any key to start playing

### Development
The modular structure makes it easy to:
- **Modify game mechanics**: Edit `constants.js` for game balance
- **Add new entities**: Create new classes in the `entities/` folder
- **Change UI behavior**: Modify `ui-manager.js`
- **Add new input methods**: Extend `input-handler.js`
- **Modify audio**: Update `audio-manager.js`

---

## Key Features
- **Object Pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles and entities
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript with import/export
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls and responsive design
- **Audio Integration**: Sound effects and background music
- **State Management**: Clean game state handling
- **Visual Direction/Thruster/Wing Triangles**: Enhanced player orientation
- **Asteroid Border Impulse**: Keeps gameplay dynamic and fair
- **Energy System**: Adds challenge and strategy

---

## Browser Compatibility
The modular version uses ES6 modules, which require:
- Modern browsers with ES6 module support
- HTTPS or localhost (modules don't work with `file://` protocol)

---

## Migration from Monolithic Version
The original `index.html` contains all code in a single file. The modular version:
1. Separates concerns into logical modules
2. Makes the codebase more maintainable
3. Enables easier testing and debugging
4. Provides better organization for future development

---

## Building for Production
For production deployment, you may want to:
1. Bundle all modules into a single file using a tool like Webpack or Rollup
2. Minify the JavaScript code
3. Optimize assets (images, audio)

---

## Contributing
When adding new features:
1. Create new modules in the appropriate directory
2. Follow the existing naming conventions
3. Use ES6 modules for imports/exports
4. Update this README if adding new modules
