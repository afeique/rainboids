# Performance Optimizations Implemented

This document describes all the canvas 2D performance optimizations that have been implemented in the Rainboids game.

## ✅ Completed Optimizations

### 1. Render Batching (`render-batch.js`)
- Created `RenderBatch` class to group entities by render state
- Minimizes state changes by batching similar draw operations
- Reduces draw calls significantly

### 2. Shadow Usage Removal
- Commented out all shadow properties across the codebase:
  - `game-engine.js`: Health bar glow effect
  - `particle.js`: Shield hit effects
  - `player.js`: Ship component shadows
  - `asteroid.js`: Edge glow effects
- Shadows are one of the most expensive canvas operations

### 3. Path2D Caching (`path-cache.js`)
- Implemented `PathCache` class for reusable shapes
- Cached paths for:
  - Ship shape
  - Thruster flames
  - Bullets
  - Star shapes (diamond, plus, star4, star8)
  - Health bar shape
- Path2D objects are created once and reused

### 4. Particle Batching (`render-batch.js`)
- Created `ParticleBatch` class using ImageData API
- Renders particles directly to pixel buffer
- Supports additive blending
- Handles thousands of particles efficiently

### 5. Quadtree Spatial Partitioning (`quadtree.js`)
- Implemented quadtree for efficient collision detection
- Reduces collision checks from O(n²) to O(n log n)
- Dynamically subdivides space based on object density
- Integrated into collision detection system

### 6. Frustum Culling (`frustum-culling.js`)
- Created `ViewFrustum` class to skip off-screen objects
- Configurable padding for smooth entry/exit
- Applied to all entity types in draw loop
- Significantly reduces draw calls for objects outside viewport

### 7. Canvas Layer Separation (`canvas-layers.js`)
- Implemented `CanvasLayers` class for multi-layer rendering
- Separate layers for:
  - Background (static)
  - Stars (rarely changes)
  - Game objects (main gameplay)
  - Effects (particles)
  - UI (HUD elements)
- Only dirty layers are redrawn

### 8. Text Caching (`text-cache.js`)
- Created `TextCache` class to pre-render text
- Specialized caches for:
  - General text
  - Damage numbers
  - Score display
- Text rendered once to offscreen canvas and reused

### 9. Minimized Save/Restore Calls (`optimized-entities.js`)
- Created optimized entity base classes
- Reduced canvas state saves/restores
- Batched state changes
- Transform management optimized

### 10. Star Field Caching (`canvas-layers.js`)
- Implemented `StarFieldCache` for background stars
- Stars rendered to cache canvas when dirty
- Cache reused until stars change

### 11. Pre-allocated Arrays (`optimized-pool-manager.js`)
- Created `OptimizedPoolManager` with fixed-size arrays
- All objects pre-created at initialization
- No dynamic allocation during gameplay
- Efficient index-based management

### 12. Performance Manager (`performance-manager.js`)
- Central hub for all optimizations
- Tracks FPS and frame times
- Manages all optimization systems
- Provides performance statistics

## Integration in Game Engine

The optimizations are integrated into `game-engine.js`:

```javascript
// Initialize
this.performanceManager = new PerformanceManager(canvas, width, height);

// Collision detection uses quadtree
this.performanceManager.addToQuadtree(entity);
const nearby = this.performanceManager.getPotentialCollisions(entity);

// Rendering uses frustum culling
const visible = this.performanceManager.filterVisible(entities);

// Particles use batching
this.performanceManager.addParticle(x, y, r, g, b, a, radius);
this.performanceManager.renderParticles(ctx);
```

## Performance Impact

These optimizations should provide:
- **2-5x improvement** in frame rate
- **50-80% reduction** in draw calls
- **Smooth 60 FPS** on most devices
- **Better mobile performance**
- **Reduced CPU usage**

## Next Steps

To further improve performance:
1. Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for distant objects
2. Add performance quality settings (low/medium/high)
3. Use Web Workers for physics calculations
4. Implement temporal upsampling
5. Add GPU acceleration where possible
